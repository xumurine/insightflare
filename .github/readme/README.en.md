> A powerful, privacy-friendly open source web analytics tool that runs entirely on Cloudflare.

Demo: [http://insight-demo.ravelloh.com](http://insight-demo.ravelloh.com/)

![ScreenShot](/.github/screenshot/001.webp)

Fully compliant with GDPR, with no cookies, so visits can be tracked legally without asking users for consent. Its original smart tracking intensity mechanism automatically adjusts visitor identifier persistence based on regional privacy regulations, balancing data integrity with privacy protection.

The frontend analytics SDK is only about 3 KB after gzip compression and is distributed through Cloudflare's global CDN for excellent performance. The SDK includes custom event tracking (`data-insightflare-event`) and performance metric tracking.

The multilingual dashboard uses unprecedented visualizations to give you a clear picture of traffic data. Its original multilingual place-name translation feature automatically translates more than 95% of place names worldwide, making it easy to understand where visitors come from.

Cloudflare's free quotas can support free tracking for 100,000 visits per day, with excellent performance from edge computing.

InsightFlare does not store raw IP information. It relies on Cloudflare for geolocation resolution, protecting user privacy while still providing highly accurate analytics.

## Quick Start

Just click the button below:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRavelloH%2FInsightFlare)

Cloudflare will automatically clone this repository and create and bind the required resources. You need to fill in the following three variables:

| Name                       | Purpose                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `DAILY_SALT_SECRET`        | Daily visitor identifier salt          |
| `DASHBOARD_SESSION_SECRET` | Dashboard login session signing secret |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Initial administrator password         |

The first two secrets are used for security-related features and must be random strings longer than 16 characters. You can generate one at [https://random.ravelloh.com/str/32](https://random.ravelloh.com/str/32). Refresh the page to get a new random string.

`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is the default administrator password. Sign in to the dashboard with the `admin` account and this password. You can change the username and password later on the personal settings page.

After filling in the variables, wait about 3 minutes for the deployment to finish. You can then sign in to the dashboard and start tracking traffic data. You can also customize the domain name on the project settings page. The default URL is `https://insightflare.<your-cloudflare-username>.workers.dev`.

## Advanced Configuration

### Configure an R2 Bucket for Cold Archive

You only need to manually create an R2 bucket if you want to enable cold archive to R2. By default, traffic data is retained for 1 year. Expired data is compressed and retained so trends and data can still be viewed, but it cannot be filtered. R2 is optional, and the Deploy Button does not require an R2 binding by default. After R2 is enabled, you can run detailed queries on data older than 1 year.

Create a bucket named `insightflare-archive` in Cloudflare. Then uncomment `[[r2_buckets]]` in `wrangler.toml` as shown below:

```toml
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "ARCHIVE_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "insightflare-archive"
preview_bucket_name = "insightflare-archive-preview"
```

### Stay Updated

InsightFlare includes a pioneering GitHub App based automatic update system to provide the simplest update experience.

Keeping your deployment updated only takes two steps:

1. Install the GitHub App for your repository. This is only required once. **Only select the repository where you deployed InsightFlare**: [Install InsightFlare Sync](https://github.com/apps/insightflare-sync/installations/new)
2. When upstream updates are available, a PR will be submitted to your repository automatically. You only need to merge that request.

## Manual Deployment

If you do not use the deploy button, deploy with the steps below:

1. Fork or clone this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create the following resources in Cloudflare:
   - D1 database
   - KV namespace
   - R2 bucket (optional, only required for cold archive to R2)
3. Edit `wrangler.toml` and bind the D1 and KV resources to the Worker
4. Fill in environment variables by referring to `.dev.vars.example`
5. Import this repository from the Worker page

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository locally: `git clone https://github.com/RavelloH/InsightFlare`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create the local database: `npm run d1:migrate:local`
4. Set environment variables by referring to `.dev.vars.example`
