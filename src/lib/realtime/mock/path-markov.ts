// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Path Markov chain — per-site path transition graph
//
//  Replaces the previous uniform path picker with a first-order Markov chain.
//  The default graph is derived from `profile.paths` ordering:
//    - paths[0] is the canonical entry node.
//    - From any path P, forward transitions toward later paths get higher
//      weight than backward transitions (mimics natural site flow).
//    - Each node has a small probability to bounce back to entry, and a
//      small probability to "stay" (refresh / re-read).
//
//  `profile.pathFlow` can override this default for sites whose structure
//  is genuinely funnel-shaped (e-commerce checkout) or branching (forum).
